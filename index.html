  <p>Minecraft is fun. You can play it anywhere. You do not need internet to play. It is fun to play on a laptop. You can build with blocks. You can take fall damage if you fall in the game. The default characters are Alex and Steve. You can tame wolves and train them to attack things.</p>

   <h2>animal crossing new horizions</h2>

    <p>This game is fun. It has relaxing music. The game clock is synced with your real time. You can only find this game on the Nintento Switch. The in-game currency is bells. You start the game by ditching your old life and moving to an island. You bring in neighbours and they are sometimes fun. You can also get them to move out by bullying them, if they are mean. You can also build stuff, but you can't customise them.</p>

   <h2>just dance</h2>

    <p>I like Just Dance. You can play songs and work out. They added a work out mode so whoever moves the most wins. Ubisoft is greedy, however and you must buy subscriptions to songs (that don't even update). I have a Nintendo switch so it is fine. The money grab subscription is also not bad. You can also connect to the internet to play against other people. I like it overall.</p>

   <h2>roblox</h2>

    <p>I like roblox. This platform allows you to program games in Lua. There are many games on Roblox. Some games are poorly made. There are a lot of bad people on Roblox. Roblox had many genres of games. They have even added voice chat. The people who make Roblox are bad, however. I dislike this game overall.</p>
